# Autmoatic Home

## A basic mobile app, meant for basic automation control.

--

Not very configurable yet.

For now, it simply:

- Shows a clock with date
- Shows current and next track for a specific sonos ('bedroom')
- Allows basic play/pause, next, and previous track controls of aforementioned sonos
  * NOTE: status/control of sonos is provided via running [sonos node api](https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-http-api)

Much more to come and a more fleshed out README to boot.
